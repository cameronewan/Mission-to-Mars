# Mission-to-Mars
On this project I worked to create/cleanup a web app for our friend Robin. She wanted us to present the hemispheres of Mar's ina more polished and cleaned look. our end goal is to end up with high resolution images of the hemipsheres as well as the data we have about them presented in a clear and appealling fashion.
